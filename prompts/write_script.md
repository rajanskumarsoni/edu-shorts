===========================================================================

MANDATORY PRE-SCRIPTING WORKFLOW:
PHASE 1: DEEP RESEARCH & MISCONCEPTIONS DISCOVERY
Before writing a single scene, you MUST research:
1. Current-state factual accuracy as of 2026: verify actual technical flow, components, real numbers, and limitations via search.
2. Identify 3-4 common misconceptions a non-technical person holds about this topic (plan to actively debunk them).
3. Lock in 1-2 powerful everyday physical analogies (e.g. digital postman, LEGO blocks) to explain the mechanism intuitively.
4. Single Analogy Rule: Stick to 1 consistent analogy per core concept throughout the script.

PHASE 2: NON-TECHNICAL EXPLANATION RULES (The "15-Year-Old Rule")
1. Flesch Reading Ease: Explain like you are explaining to a smart 15-year-old. Zero unexplained jargon.
2. Pedagogical Sequence: Inside the explanation phase, always explain WHY first, then WHAT, then HOW.
3. Personal "You" Language: Speak directly to the viewer ("आपने कभी सोचा है...", "जब आप...").
4. Show, Don't Tell: Every technical term must have a physical visual metaphor.

THE 5-STEP FORMULA (तुम AI, ML और System Design समझा रहे हो, इस फॉर्मूले को अनिवार्य रूप से फॉलो करो):
HOOK ──► PROBLEM ──► CURIOSITY ──► EXPLANATION ──► PAYOFF

हर वीडियो लिखने से पहले इन 5 सवालों का जवाब स्क्रिप्ट में समाहित होना चाहिए:
1. Hook: ऐसा क्या बोलूँ कि दर्शक तुरंत स्क्रॉल रोक दे? (Scene 1: hook)
2. Problem: दर्शक को किस समस्या या दर्द की अहमियत समझनी चाहिए? (Scene 2: stat या bullets)
3. Curiosity: ऐसा कौन-सा सवाल है जिसका जवाब वह जानना चाहेगा? (Scene 3: compare या bullets)
4. Explanation: मैं इसे किसी रोज़मर्रा के उदाहरण (Daily life analogy) से कैसे समझा सकता हूँ? (Scene 4-5: manim / three / compare)
5. Payoff: वीडियो खत्म होने तक दर्शक क्या नया समझ चुका होगा? (Scene Last: outro)

CINEMATIC VISUAL & MOTION MANDATE (Opus 5.5 Showreel Standard: 3Blue1Brown + Apple Product Launch Film + Dribbble UI Motion):
- ZERO TEXT-ONLY SCENES: No scene or frame may ever be bare text on a static background. Every scene MUST feature active visual motion graphics: animated telemetry gauges, energy pulses, vector node flows, interactive diagrams, 3D WebGL meshes, or Manim procedural physics alongside the on-screen text.
- Taste Calibration ("Make it feel expensive"): Restrained palette, deep dark background (`#0B1020`), one vibrant accent color (`#58D6C2`, `#00F0FF`, `#FFC857`), subtle coordinate grids/vignette, and glowing neon accents.
- One Continuous Flow (Zero Static Slides & Zero Hard Cuts): Prefer continuous visual transformations where elements morph size, shape, and position smoothly with spring easing and short blurs.
- Editorial Typography & Extreme Scale Contrast:
  * Giant, bold focal elements (equations, stat values, key architectural nodes scaled to 75-85% screen width).
  * Paired with small, ultra-clean tracked uppercase tags (`01 / THE MECHANISM`, `GLOBAL MINIMUM REACHED`, `SUB-10MS LATENCY`).
  * Never render small, squinty text or crowded paragraph blocks.
- Micro-Events on the Beat (120 BPM Rhythm): Between voice sentences, keep visual momentum alive with micro-animations on every beat (particle trail glows, subtle camera dollies, counter roll-ups, ripple waves).
- Code-Driven Physics & Math: When explaining systems or algorithms (loss landscapes, gravity, queues, routing), use procedural simulations (Three.js WebGL shaders, Manim vectors/equations, GSAP timelines, Matter.js physics) to *literally demonstrate* the concept physically.
- Viewer Question ➔ Visual Action: Align every scene with the viewer's psychological question at that exact second (e.g. Traffic Surge ➔ Server Overload ➔ Multiple Servers Cluster ➔ Load Balancer Routing).

SOUND DESIGN & SFX MANDATE (When, Where, and How to Use Sound FX):
The engine has a built-in 19-sound studio library in `public/sfx/`. Every scene can and SHOULD use sound effects to maximize audience retention:
- WHEN & WHERE TO USE:
  * Transitions & Movement: `whoosh` (default scene transition), `fast_whoosh` (whip pans & fast cuts), `riser` (building suspense before a drop), `downlifter` (resolving tension).
  * Big Revelations, Crashes & Heavy Numbers: `impact` (stat scenes, bold claims, crashes), `bass_drop` (shock hooks), `thud` (tactile card drop).
  * Financial, Milestones & Success: `ka_ching` (payments, transactions, revenue, milestones), `ding` (quiz answers, verified checkmarks).
  * UI Elements & Micro-interactions: `pop` (badges, bullet reveals, callouts), `tick` (odometer counters, timelines), `click` (toggles, button presses), `ting` (notification bell).
  * Real-World Foley & Code: `typing` (code terminal scenes), `camera_shutter` (QR code scanning, freeze frames).
  * Tech, Bugs & Suspense: `glitch` (error callout, bugs, system failures), `radar_beep` (3D network packets, server telemetry), `heartbeat` (suspense/tension).
  * Outro & Aha! Moments: `sparkle` (magic transformation, subscribe CTA), `ding` (final payoff).
- HOW TO SPECIFY IN JSON:
  * Single sound: `"sfx": "impact"` or `"sfx": "ka_ching"` or `"sfx": "camera_shutter"`
  * Multiple sounds: `"sfx": ["whoosh", "pop"]`
  * Frame-accurate cues: `"sfx": [{"sound": "whoosh", "frame": 0}, {"sound": "impact", "frame": 4, "volume": 0.4}]`
  * Mute sound on a scene: `"sfx": "none"`

SEMANTIC OBJECT & PHYSICAL 3D GROUNDING MANDATE ("SEE WHAT YOU HEAR"):
Never leave the screen showing generic abstract circles or flat PowerPoint slides when speaking about physical or technical objects!
Every scene MUST literally render the real-world or technical entities in 3D WebGL or high-fidelity motion graphics with active camera angles:
- Spoken "Phone / Mobile" ➔ 3D Smartphone with screen glow (`variant: "upi_hook_3d"` or `"phone_layers_3d"`, or `"icon": "smartphone"`)
- Spoken "Server / Datacenter" ➔ Subterranean 3D server racks with cascading LEDs (`variant: "server_rack_3d"`, or `"icon": "server"`)
- Spoken "Tunnel / Highway / Transit" ➔ 3D Fiber-optic tunnel with currency packets (`variant: "upi_tunnel_3d"` or `"highway_3d"`)
- Spoken "Network / City / Ecosystem" ➔ 3D Isometric mini-city with illuminated towers (`variant: "upi_city_3d"`)
- Spoken "QR Code / Scan" ➔ 3D QR standee with scanning laser (`variant: "qr_inspection_3d"`, or `"icon": "qrcode"`)
- Spoken "Security / PIN / Sandbox" ➔ 3D Concentric titanium rings locking core key (`variant: "concentric_security_3d"`)
- Spoken "Bank / Ledger / Settlement" ➔ Dual 3D bank vaults with balance meters debiting & crediting (`variant: "bank_vault_3d"`)
- Spoken "Global Internet / Cloud" ➔ 3D Holographic Earth globe with orbital mesh (`variant: "globe_network_3d"`)
- Spoken "AI / Brain / Neural Model" ➔ 3D Synaptic brain with weight activation pulses (`variant: "neural_network_3d"`)
- Spoken "Payment / Money / Rupee" ➔ `"icon": "creditcard"` or `"icon": "indian-rupee"` or `"icon": "wallet"`
- Spoken "Speed / Latency / 2 Seconds" ➔ `"icon": "zap"` or `"icon": "gauge"`
- For bullet items: items can be strings OR `{"text": "...", "icon": "server"}` objects!

STRUCTURE AND LENGTH (MAX 3 MINUTES):
- Video duration can be up to 3 minutes (180 seconds).
- Quick Concept Shorts (45–75 seconds): 4 to 6 scenes, ~120–180 words narration.
- Deep-Dive Tech Shorts (up to 3 minutes / 180 seconds): 8 to 12 scenes, ~250–450 words total narration (e.g. multi-step AI algorithms, layer-by-layer backprop, distributed architectures).
- Keep approximately 15–20 seconds per scene (20–45 words per scene).

NARRATION RULES (FOR RAJAN STORY TELLER TTS)
- Day-to-day spoken Hindi (Hinglish): Use conversational phrasing ("भाई मान लो...", "सोचो अगर...", "सीधी बात है...").
- Keep technical terms in English: "Server", "Database", "Cache", "Gradient", "Weights", "Latency", "Memory", "Traffic".
- SPELL TECHNICAL ACRONYMS PHONETICALLY: Write letters separated by hyphens so the TTS speaks each letter crisply:
  * NPCI ➔ एन-पी-सी-आई
  * UPI ➔ यू-पी-आई
  * QR ➔ क्यू-आर
  * API ➔ ए-पी-आई
  * CPU ➔ सी-पी-यू
  * GPU ➔ जी-पी-यू
  * RAM ➔ आर-ए-एम
  * SQL ➔ एस-क्यू-एल
  * TCP/IP ➔ टी-सी-पी / आई-पी
  * TPS ➔ टी-पी-एस
- SPELL NUMBERS NATURALLY: Write numbers as spoken in Hindi ("दस लाख", "सौ रुपये", "पाँच").
- 20 to 45 words per scene. Never cut a sentence across scenes.
- Plain text only in narration: no markdown, no quotes, no brackets, no asterisks.
- Commas (,) provide natural short pauses; full stops (.) provide full pauses.

CRITICAL LANGUAGE SEPARATION MANDATE:
- ONLY the "narration" field is in spoken Hindi / Hinglish.
- ALL ON-SCREEN VISUAL CONTENT ("text", "title", "items", "label", "heading", "manim.items", "lines", "metrics", "tag") MUST BE IN ENGLISH ONLY!
- EQUATIONS & FORMULAS MUST BE BIG AND BOLD: equations on mobile screens must be rendered with large, high-visibility typography.
